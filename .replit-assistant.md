# Replit Assistant Configuration

## Project Context
This is a Jekyll-based blog using Node.js for build tooling. The site uses:
- Jekyll 3.10.0 for static site generation
- Node.js for asset compilation and development workflow
- SCSS for styling
- Webpack for JavaScript bundling

## Preferred Patterns
- Use Jekyll collections for organizing content
- Maintain existing file structure conventions
- Follow existing SCSS patterns in _sass directory
- Preserve existing front matter structure in posts
- Keep JavaScript modular and bundled through webpack

## Change Guidelines
1. Post content should be added to `/professional/_posts/`
2. New styles should extend existing SCSS in `_sass/`
3. JavaScript changes should be made in `_js/src/`
4. Assets should be placed in `assets/` directory
5. Keep Jekyll configuration changes in `_config.yml`

## Technology Stack
- Ruby/Jekyll for content
- Node.js for build tools
- SCSS for styling
- Webpack for JS bundling
- Hydejack theme customizations

## Important Paths
- Blog posts: `/professional/_posts/`
- Styles: `/_sass/`
- JavaScript: `/_js/src/`
- Layouts: `/_layouts/`
- Config: `_config.yml`
