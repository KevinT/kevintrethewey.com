# Replit Assistant Configuration

## Project Context
This is a Jekyll-based blog using Node.js for build tooling. The site uses:
- Jekyll 3.10.0 for static site generation
- Node.js for asset compilation and development workflow
- SCSS for styling
- Webpack for JavaScript bundling
- Hydejack theme with custom modifications

## Preferred Patterns
- Use Jekyll collections for organizing content
- Maintain existing file structure conventions
- Follow existing SCSS patterns in _sass directory
- Preserve existing front matter structure in posts
- Keep JavaScript modular and bundled through webpack
- Use Liquid templating idioms already present in layouts
- Avoid large framework additions—prefer lightweight enhancements

## Change Guidelines
1. Post content should be added to `/professional/_posts/`
2. New styles should extend existing SCSS in `_sass/`
3. JavaScript changes should be made in `_js/src/`
4. Assets should be placed in `assets/` directory
5. Keep Jekyll configuration changes in `_config.yml`
6. Avoid hardcoding URLs—use Liquid filters and site.url where possible
7. Preserve permalink structures to avoid breaking existing URLs
8. New features or experiments should be implemented behind config flags or clearly documented

## Technology Stack
- Ruby/Jekyll for content
- Node.js for build tools
- SCSS for styling
- Webpack for JS bundling
- Hydejack theme customizations
- Markdown with YAML front matter

## Important Paths
- Blog posts: `/professional/_posts/`
- Styles: `/_sass/`
- JavaScript: `/_js/src/`
- Layouts: `/_layouts/`
- Config: `_config.yml`
- Includes: /_includes/
- Data: /_data/ for YAML/JSON used in templates

## Deployment
This codebase is used to publish kevintrethewey.com via github pages

- Do not add GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipelines—deployment is managed by GitHub Pages
- Ensure any added gems or plugins are GitHub Pages compatible
- Minimize Ruby gem changes unless necessary

## Commit Practices
- Atomic commits for each change or feature
- Use clear commit messages with context
- Don't commit generated _site/ directory

## Assistant-Specific Instructions
- Always confirm changes to _config.yml with the user before applying
- Do not auto-upgrade Jekyll or Node dependencies without user consent
- Explain any build tool changes clearly before modifying package.json or Webpack config
- Warn the user when making exerimental changes on master branch
