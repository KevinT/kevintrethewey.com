      "criterion": "All previously existing games in `springboks-results.json` are preserved unchanged",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code loaded existing data (found 0 games), merged it properly, and saved it back. The merge_game_data() function explicitly preserves existing games and only adds new ones based on unique identifiers."

      "criterion": "Any new or missing Springbok games found from the source are added to `springboks-results.json`",
      "passed": false,
      "explanation": "No games were added because the data fetch failed with '404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.espn.com/rugby/team/fixtures-results/_/id/2359/south-africa'. The URL appears to be incorrect or the ESPN site structure has changed."

      "criterion": "Each game record includes: date, opponent, score, scorers, and player performance data",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code structure in fetch_springbok_results() creates game objects with all required fields: date, opponent, scores, try_scorers, conversion_scorers, penalty_scorers, drop_goal_scorers, and player_performance. While no games were fetched, the data structure is correct."

    {
      "criterion": "The most recent game date has been correctly identified",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code correctly identifies and tracks the most recent game date (currently None since no games were fetched). The save_results() function properly determines most_recent_date from the sorted games list."

      "criterion": "If a new game was detected: A new file `./output/springbok-coach-tips-YYYY-MMM-DD.md` exists with the correct date",
      "passed": true,

      "criterion": "If a new game was detected: The coaching tips file contains exactly 3 coaching suggestions",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "N/A - No new game was detected. However, the generate_coaching_tips() function's prompt explicitly requires 'EXACTLY 3 specific, actionable coaching suggestions', so when triggered, it would meet this criterion."

    {
      "criterion": "If a new game was detected: The suggestions are based on the most recent game information",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "N/A - No new game was detected. The code logic shows it would analyze recent_games[:5] and pass them to the LLM for analysis when a new game is detected."

      "criterion": "If no new game was detected: No new coaching tips file was created",
      "passed": true,

      "criterion": "If no new game was detected: The most recent existing coaching tips file (if any) remains unchanged",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code did not attempt to modify any existing files when no new game was detected. It only saves new coaching tips when new_game_detected is True."

This is not a transient external issue but rather a code problem where the hardcoded URL is wrong. Regeneration should research and use the correct ESPN Scrum URL for South Africa's fixtures/results, or implement an alternative data source. The rest of the code logic is sound, but without fixing the data source URL, the system cannot fulfill its core purpose of tracking Springbok games.",
