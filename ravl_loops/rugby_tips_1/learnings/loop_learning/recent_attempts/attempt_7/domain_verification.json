      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The execution log shows the file was created successfully: 'Saved 0 games to output/springboks-results.json'. The code structure creates valid JSON with proper schema including games array, last_updated, most_recent_game_date, and total_games fields."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "All previously existing game data is preserved in the JSON file",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code properly loads existing data via load_existing_data() and merges it with new data using merge_game_data(). The merge function uses set-based deduplication to avoid duplicates while preserving existing games. In this execution, 0 existing games were preserved (starting from empty), which is correct behavior."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Any newly discovered games have been added to the JSON file with complete information (date, opponent, score, scorers, player performance)",
      "passed": false,
      "explanation": "No new games were discovered due to a 404 error from ESPN Scrum API ('404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.espn.com/rugby/team/fixtures-results/_/id/2359/south-africa'). The code structure includes all required fields (date, opponent, scores, try_scorers, conversion_scorers, penalty_scorers, drop_goal_scorers, player_performance), but the data source is currently unavailable. This is an external data availability issue, not a code logic problem."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "The JSON structure is consistent across all game entries",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code creates a consistent game object structure with all required fields for each game entry. The schema is well-defined in the fetch_springbok_results() function with standardized fields across all entries."

    {
      "criterion": "If a new game was detected: `./output/springbok-coach-tips-YYYY-MMM-DD.md` exists with today's date and contains exactly 3 coaching suggestions",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "No new game was detected (most_recent_game_date remained None), so this criterion is satisfied by not creating a coaching tips file. The execution log confirms: 'NO NEW GAME DETECTED - SKIPPING COACHING TIPS'."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "If no new game was detected: no new coaching tips file was created",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code correctly identified no new game was detected and skipped the coaching tips generation, as shown in the execution log. The conditional logic (if new_game_detected) properly gates the tips generation."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Coaching suggestions (if generated) are based on the most recent game data and are specific, actionable recommendations for Rassie",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "No coaching suggestions were generated since no new game was detected. When generated, the code uses an LLM with a well-structured prompt that requests exactly 3 specific, actionable tips based on recent game patterns. The prompt design ensures tips would be relevant and professional."

    "Implement more robust error handling that distinguishes between temporary network issues (should retry) vs permanent URL changes (should alert for manual intervention)",

This is a code configuration issue (wrong URL) rather than a transient external failure. Regeneration should focus on finding the correct ESPN URL structure or switching to an alternative reliable data source for Springbok rugby results. The core logic is sound, but the data source URL needs correction to make the system functional.",
