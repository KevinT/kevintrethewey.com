    "This is an EXECUTION FAILURE, not a domain verification failure. The code crashed due to a 404 error from the ESPN website (likely the URL is incorrect or the site structure changed).",
    "The code shows good domain logic - it has fallback sample data and proper handling for generating coaching tips, but this never executed due to the web scraping failure.",
    "Fix the execution issue by: (1) correcting the ESPN Scrum URL, (2) using the fallback sample data approach earlier in the code flow, or (3) using an alternative data source for Springbok match results.",
    "The verification criteria cannot be properly evaluated because the code failed at the infrastructure/execution level (HTTP 404), not at the domain quality level.",
    "This failure should be logged in `execution_learning/` not `loop_learning/` since it's a technical execution issue rather than a domain quality problem."
