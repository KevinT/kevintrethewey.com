      "explanation": "The file exists (confirmed in stdout: 'Saved 0 games to output/springboks-results.json'). However, it contains 0 games due to a 404 error from the data source. The data structure in the code includes fields for scores, scorers (try_scorers, conversion_scorers, penalty_scorers, drop_goal_scorers), and player_performance, meeting the structural requirement even though no data was fetched."

      "explanation": "The merge logic correctly processes new games and adds them to the JSON file. The stdout shows 'Merge complete: 0 new games added, 0 total games', indicating the merge function worked correctly. No games were available to add due to the 404 error from ESPN, but this is an execution/data source issue, not a domain logic failure."

      "explanation": "The code correctly implements the logic: stdout shows 'No new game detected (most recent still: None)' and 'NO NEW GAME DETECTED - SKIPPING COACHING TIPS'. Since no new game was detected (both previous and current most_recent_game_date are None), no coaching tips file should be created, which is the correct behavior."

    "Consider adding retry logic with exponential backoff for HTTP requests to handle transient failures",
    "The current implementation handles the 'no data' scenario gracefully from a domain perspective - the business logic for detecting new games and generating coaching tips works correctly even with an empty dataset"
