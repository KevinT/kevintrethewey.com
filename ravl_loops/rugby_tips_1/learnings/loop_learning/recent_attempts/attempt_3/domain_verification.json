    {
      "criterion": "`./output/springboks-results.json` exists and contains valid JSON",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The execution log shows '\u2713 Saved 0 games to output/springboks-results.json', confirming the file was created. The code structure shows proper JSON serialization with json.dump()."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "The JSON file includes games with scores, scorers, and individual player performance data",
      "passed": false,
      "explanation": "The JSON file was created but contains 0 games due to a 404 error when fetching data from ESPN ('404 Client Error: Not Found for url'). No game data with scores, scorers, or performance metrics was successfully retrieved."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "All new games found from the source have been added to the dataset",
      "passed": false,
      "explanation": "No games were found due to the ESPN URL returning a 404 error. The merge process completed with '0 new games added, 0 total games', indicating the data source is inaccessible or the URL is incorrect."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Existing games have been preserved and any gaps filled with new data",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code correctly loaded existing data (showing 'Found 0 existing games') and attempted to merge. While no new data was fetched, existing data preservation logic is in place and would work correctly if data were available."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "The most recent game date in the dataset has been correctly identified",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code correctly identifies 'Most recent game: None' since no games exist in the dataset. The logic for tracking most_recent_game_date is properly implemented."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "If a more recent game exists: A new file `./output/springbok-coach-tips-YYYY-MMM-DD.md` has been created with today's date",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "No new game was detected (correctly determined as 'NO NEW GAME DETECTED'), so no coaching tips file should be created. The condition logic is working as expected."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "If a more recent game exists: The file contains exactly 3 coaching suggestions for Rassie",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "N/A - No coaching tips file was created, which is correct behavior when no new game is detected. The prompt template in the code does specify 'EXACTLY 3 specific, actionable coaching suggestions'."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "If a more recent game exists: The suggestions are based on the most recent game information",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "N/A - No coaching tips were generated, which is correct. The code logic would analyze recent games (last 5) if they existed."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "If no more recent game exists: No new coaching tips file has been created",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "Confirmed by log output: 'NO NEW GAME DETECTED - SKIPPING COACHING TIPS'. No coaching tips file was created, which is the correct behavior."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "If no more recent game exists: Previous coaching tips files remain unchanged",
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "The code only creates new coaching tips files when new games are detected. No file modification operations occur when no new game is detected, so previous files would remain unchanged."
