While it contains 0 games due to the ESPN scraping failure (404 error), the file structure is correct with fields for scores, scorers (try_scorers, conversion_scorers, penalty_scorers, drop_goal_scorers), and player_performance.

      "explanation": "No new games were found (0 games scraped due to ESPN 404 error), and therefore no games needed to be added. The code correctly handled the empty dataset without crashing.
