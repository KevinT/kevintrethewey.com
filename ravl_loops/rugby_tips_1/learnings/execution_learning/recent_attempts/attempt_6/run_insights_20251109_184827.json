    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal actionable context. Historical learnings were present (DSL iterations, verified code) but no domain-specific guidance about data source reliability, fallback strategies, or known ESPN URL issues from previous 404 failures.",
      "gaps": [
        "No warning about ESPN URL fragility despite multiple 404 errors in previous runs",
        "No guidance on alternative data sources for Springbok results",
        "No context about what constitutes 'individual player performance analysis' - leading to incomplete data structure",
        "No prioritization of which coaching analysis dimensions matter most to Rassie"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT correctly reused verified code and handled the ESPN 404 gracefully without crashing. However, it showed no agency in seeking alternative data sources or enriching player performance analysis when the primary source failed repeatedly.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Graceful error handling - code didn't crash on 404, logged warning appropriately",
        "Correct conditional logic - no coaching tips created when no new game detected",
        "Data preservation - existing game data structure maintained even with 0 games",
        "Change detection logic properly implemented"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "No proactive search for alternative Springbok results sources despite repeated ESPN failures",
        "Player performance analysis remains superficial (empty try_scorers, conversion_scorers fields suggest scraping doesn't capture individual contributions)",
        "No attempt to use LLM to enrich basic score data with performance insights",
        "Cached code reused without considering that ESPN URL has consistently failed"
      ]
    },
    "verification_outcomes": {
      "overall_passed": true,
      "key_issues": [
        "Technical pass but business failure - 0 games means no actual coaching value delivered",
        "Player performance analysis structure exists but remains empty/untested",
        "Coaching tips generation logic untested due to no game data"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Consider implementing alternative data sources or fallback URLs in case the primary ESPN URL returns 404 errors",
        "Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network failures",
        "Consider scraping from multiple rugby statistics websites to increase resilience",
        "Add validation to detect when the ESPN URL structure may have changed"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Verification passing with 0 games indicates criteria are too lenient - should fail when no business value delivered",
      "Repeated ESPN 404 errors across multiple runs suggests need for data source diversity strategy, not just retry logic",
      "Player performance analysis is specified in requirements but implementation remains shallow - need clearer definition of what 'how well each individual played' means",
      "Coaching tips generation has never been tested in practice - LLM prompt quality unknown",
      "System optimizes for technical correctness over business value delivery"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should flag ESPN URL as unreliable and prioritize finding alternative sources (SA Rugby official site, RugbyPass, World Rugby)",
      "REFLECT should provide specific guidance on player performance metrics to track: tackles made, meters gained, turnovers won, penalties conceded, minutes played",
      "ACT should demonstrate agency by researching alternative data sources when primary fails, not just logging warnings",
      "VERIFY criteria should require minimum game count or flag runs where 0 games represents business failure",
      "Consider two-phase approach: Phase 1 uses simpler source for basic scores/dates, Phase 2 uses LLM to analyze match reports for player performance insights",
      "Add explicit learning: 'ESPN Scrum URL unstable - prioritize SA Rugby official fixtures orRugbyPass API'"
