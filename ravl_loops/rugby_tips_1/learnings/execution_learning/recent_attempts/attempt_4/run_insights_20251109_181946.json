    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided basic context from previous runs but missed critical information about the persistent data source failure pattern. The context included DSL iterations and verified code, but didn't highlight the recurring 404 error as a domain problem requiring alternative solutions.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit warning about ESPN URL reliability from previous failed attempts",
        "No guidance to explore alternative data sources given repeated 404 errors",
        "Missing context about what fallback strategies could be used when primary source fails",
        "No indication that the data source problem is blocking all verification criteria"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT reused cached code that had already failed in previous runs without attempting alternatives. The code has good structure and error handling, but the agent didn't exercise agency to solve the fundamental data source problem. The agent accepted the 404 error rather than finding solutions.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Proper data preservation logic - existing games would be maintained if they existed",
        "Conditional coaching tips generation - correctly skips when no new game found",
        "Clean code structure with separate functions for loading, fetching, merging, and analysis",
        "Good error handling that prevents crashes and provides clear status messages"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "No attempt to find alternative data sources despite repeated 404 errors",
        "Cached code reuse without considering that the approach had already failed",
        "No exploration of different ESPN URLs or rugby data APIs",
        "Didn't attempt web search to find working Springbok results sources",
        "No use of LLM to research current data sources for Springbok rugby results"

      "key_issues": [
        "ESPN URL returns 404 - data source is fundamentally broken",
        "Zero games fetched across multiple runs due to source unavailability",
        "Cannot verify data quality criteria when no data can be obtained",
        "Coaching tips generation cannot be tested without real game data"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add fallback data sources or update URL to ensure game data reliability",
        "Validate ESPN page structure hasn't changed before parsing",
        "Add more detailed player performance data collection beyond scorers",
        "Create notifications when data source unavailable",
        "Make date parsing more robust with dateutil.parser"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "The system is technically working correctly but solving the wrong problem - it gracefully handles a broken data source instead of finding a working one",
      "VERIFY passes all criteria but this is misleading - it's verifying code logic rather than domain outcomes (no actual rugby data is being collected)",
      "The loop is stuck in a pattern: cached code \u2192 404 error \u2192 graceful handling \u2192 pass verification \u2192 no domain progress",
      "The agent needs explicit permission/guidance to explore alternative approaches when a data source repeatedly fails",
      "Success metrics should distinguish between 'code executed without errors' and 'domain goal achieved' (collecting Springbok game data)"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should explicitly identify the data source as the critical blocker and prioritize finding alternatives (ESPN alternate URLs, World Rugby API, rugby stats sites)",
      "REFLECT should suggest using LLM to research and identify current working sources for Springbok rugby results before coding",
      "ACT should explore multiple data sources: try alternate ESPN URLs (team ID variations), check RugbyPass, World Rugby official site, or sports APIs",
      "ACT should use web search or LLM research to find current reliable sources rather than assuming cached approach will work",
      "VERIFY should add a critical criterion: 'At least 1 game was successfully fetched from the data source' to catch this failure mode",
      "Consider a two-phase approach: Phase 1 - research and validate data source availability, Phase 2 - implement scraping/collection",
      "Add a verification criterion that tracks whether the domain goal is being met over time (e.g., games collected > 0 within 3 runs)"
