    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context - empty domain_guidance and only basic file references from previous failed run. No analysis of why ESPN URL failed, no alternative data sources suggested, no guidance on scraping approach.",
      "gaps": [
        "No analysis of previous 404 error from ESPN URL",
        "No alternative rugby data sources identified",
        "No guidance on expected data structure for player performance metrics",
        "No domain knowledge about where comprehensive rugby statistics are available",
        "Missing context about typical rugby match data granularity (basic scores vs detailed player stats)"

    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT attempted a different ESPN URL but still encountered 404. Code structure is solid with proper error handling and conditional logic, but failed to adapt strategy when primary data source was unavailable. No exploration of alternative sources.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Proper incremental data merging logic to prevent data loss",
        "Conditional coaching tips generation based on new game detection",
        "Well-structured LLM prompt for coaching suggestions with specific requirements",
        "Graceful degradation when no data found (didn't crash, just skipped coaching tips)",

      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "Did not explore alternative rugby data sources after ESPN failed",
        "Scraper only captures basic match data, leaving player performance fields empty even when successful",
        "No fallback strategy when primary URL returns 404",
        "Did not address VERIFY's suggestion from previous run about alternative data sources"

      "key_issues": [
        "ESPN data source returns 404 - URL is incorrect or outdated",
        "Even with correct URL, scraper doesn't capture detailed player statistics (try scorers, individual performance)",
        "No games fetched means core requirement unfulfilled"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Fix the data source URL - try alternative ESPN endpoints or other rugby statistics sites",
        "Enhance scraper to capture detailed match statistics from individual game pages",
        "Add error recovery with alternative data sources",
        "Add data validation before merging",
        "Improve date parsing robustness"

    "strategic_insights": [
      "The loop needs domain research phase: identifying reliable rugby data sources is a prerequisite before scraping",
      "Two-level data problem: (1) finding accessible source, (2) extracting detailed statistics - may need multi-page scraping strategy",
      "Current approach assumes single-page scraping suffices, but detailed player stats likely require clicking into individual match pages",
      "VERIFY is identifying the right issues but REFLECT isn't converting these into actionable context for ACT",
      "Loop is stuck in local minimum: trying variations of same approach rather than pivoting to different data strategy"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should research and provide 3-5 specific rugby data source URLs with rationale (ESPN alternatives, World Rugby, official Springbok sites, rugby stats sites like Ultimate Rugby or RugbyPass)",
      "REFLECT should specify scraping architecture: basic match list + detailed match pages, or single comprehensive API",
      "ACT should implement multi-source fallback: try source 1, if fails try source 2, etc.",
      "ACT should validate ESPN URL structure first with a test request before building full scraper",
      "If comprehensive player stats unavailable, ACT should explicitly document this limitation and generate coaching tips based on available data (match results, win/loss patterns, opponent analysis)",
      "VERIFY suggestions from previous run should be explicitly tracked in REFLECT as priority items to address",
      "Consider using official rugby APIs (World Rugby, Six Nations, Rugby Championship) or established sports data providers rather than web scraping"
