    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal actionable context. Historical learnings were loaded but not effectively surfaced. The DSL iteration history showed 404 errors in previous attempts, but this critical pattern wasn't highlighted in domain_guidance priority_focus or failed_patterns.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit warning about ESPN URL 404 failures from previous runs",
        "No guidance to explore alternative data sources after repeated failures",
        "Missing pattern recognition: same URL failed multiple times across iterations",
        "No prioritization of data source validation as a key context need"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT reused cached code that had a known data source failure without attempting remediation. The code structure is well-designed with proper error handling, merge logic, and conditional coaching tips generation, but the fundamental issue (broken ESPN URL) was not addressed despite multiple prior failures.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Robust code structure with proper data merging and deduplication",
        "Conditional logic correctly skips coaching tips when no new games detected",
        "Clean error handling that allows graceful degradation",
        "Proper preservation of existing data structure",
        "LLM-based coaching tip generation with well-structured prompts"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "Reused cached code with known 404 error without attempting URL correction",
        "Did not explore alternative data sources (ESPN.co.uk, World Rugby API, RugbyPass)",
        "No validation or health check on data source before execution",
        "Failed to learn from repeated 404 patterns across multiple iterations"
      ]

    "verification_outcomes": {
      "overall_passed": false,
      "key_issues": [
        "ESPN Scrum URL returns 404 - data source is broken",
        "Zero games fetched due to external data unavailability",
        "Cannot fulfill core requirement: tracking Springbok game results"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Use alternative data sources: World Rugby API, RugbyPass, ESPN.co.uk",
        "Add fallback data sources for resilience",
        "Implement URL validation before scraping",
        "Distinguish between transient vs permanent failures",
        "Add validation when 0 games returned to diagnose parsing vs source issues"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Cached code optimization created a learning blindspot - the system reused failing code without reconsidering the approach",
      "External data source failures require proactive remediation strategies, not just error handling",
      "Pattern recognition across iterations is critical: 404 errors in logs should trigger data source review in REFLECT",
      "The gap between 'code executes successfully' and 'code achieves domain objective' needs explicit tracking",
      "Domain success metrics (games fetched, tips generated) should influence cache invalidation decisions"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should parse execution logs for repeated error patterns and surface them as priority focus areas",
      "REFLECT should explicitly flag when cached code has known limitations and recommend regeneration",
      "ACT should validate data sources before reusing cached code, especially after external API failures",
      "ACT should research and implement alternative data sources when primary source fails repeatedly",
      "Add domain-aware cache invalidation: invalidate cache when execution succeeds but produces zero meaningful results",
      "VERIFY recommendations marked as 'recommend_code_regeneration' should trigger REFLECT to deprioritize cache reuse",
      "Build a data source reliability tracker: after N failures, automatically explore alternatives",
      "Create explicit learning pattern: 'external_data_source_failure' with remediation strategies"
