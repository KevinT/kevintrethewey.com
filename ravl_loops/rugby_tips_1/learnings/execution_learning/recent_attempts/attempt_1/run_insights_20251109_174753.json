      "assessment": "REFLECT provided clear task definition from ravl_loop.md but failed to provide guidance on data source resilience or fallback strategies. No historical learning about web scraping challenges or alternative data sources was present.",
      "gaps": [
        "No guidance on handling unreliable web data sources",
        "No historical patterns about ESPN URL structures or reliability",

      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated good domain understanding with comprehensive logic for game tracking, player analysis, and coaching tip generation. The code included fallback sample data showing awareness of potential data access issues, but placed it too late in execution flow. Data source selection (ESPN URL) was made without validation.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Proper state management - loading existing results before fetching new data",
        "Clear date-based logic for determining when to generate coaching tips",

        "Code failed at infrastructure level (404 HTTP error) preventing domain evaluation",

        "Fix execution by correcting ESPN URL or using alternative data source",

    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Domain logic was sound but undermined by data source selection - need to separate data acquisition strategy from data processing strategy",
      "The presence of fallback data in the code suggests ACT anticipated failure but didn't architect for it properly",
      "VERIFY correctly identified this as execution failure not domain failure, but the distinction matters for learning: the domain approach was correct, the implementation strategy was flawed",
      "For web-dependent tasks, data source validation should be treated as a domain decision requiring explicit strategy, not just an implementation detail"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should provide guidance on data source validation strategies - test URLs or provide known-good alternatives before full implementation",
      "ACT should implement 'data source discovery phase' - validate access to data sources before building complex processing logic around them",
      "Consider restructuring approach: use sample/mock data for initial implementation, then add live data source as enhancement once core logic is verified",
      "Add to domain_guidance a pattern: 'For web scraping tasks, always validate data source accessibility in first iteration, implement full processing in second iteration'",
      "REFLECT should include in context_needs: 'verified data sources' or 'fallback data strategy' for tasks requiring external data",
      "Future iterations should prioritize working end-to-end flow with sample data over sophisticated data acquisition that may fail"
