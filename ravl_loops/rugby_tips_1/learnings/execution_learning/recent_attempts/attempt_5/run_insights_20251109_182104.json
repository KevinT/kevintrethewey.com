      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal domain guidance despite prior run failures. Historical learnings existed but weren't effectively surfaced to guide ACT away from the known ESPN 404 issue.",
      "gaps": [
        "No warning about the recurring ESPN 404 error pattern from previous runs",
        "No suggestion to try alternative data sources after ESPN failed multiple times",
        "Missing pattern recognition that ESPN URL has failed consistently across iterations",
        "No guidance on fallback strategies when primary data source is unavailable"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT reused cached code that contained a known failing ESPN URL. While the domain logic (merge, date tracking, conditional coaching tips) is sound, ACT didn't adapt to the persistent data source failure.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Robust data merge logic that preserves existing games and handles empty datasets gracefully",
        "Clear conditional logic for coaching tips generation (only when new games detected)",
        "Comprehensive data structure including scores, scorers, and player performance fields",
        "Proper error handling that allows the process to complete despite fetch failures",
        "Date-based sorting and tracking of most recent game"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "Continued reliance on ESPN URL that returns 404 errors across multiple runs",
        "No attempt to find alternative rugby data sources despite repeated failures",
        "Cached code reuse without evaluating whether the data source issue was resolved",
        "No proactive data source validation or alternative source exploration"

    "verification_outcomes": {
      "overall_passed": true,
      "key_issues": [
        "Zero games fetched due to ESPN 404 error - no actual domain work accomplished",
        "Business goal (tracking Springbok games and generating coaching tips) cannot be fulfilled without valid data source",
        "System passes verification on technical logic but fails on practical utility"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Implement fallback data sources in case ESPN's URL structure changes or becomes unavailable",
        "Add validation to warn users when zero games are fetched",
        "Consider retry logic with exponential backoff for HTTP requests",
        "The 404 error suggests the URL may be incorrect or outdated"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Verification criteria focus on code logic correctness but miss the critical domain failure: no actual rugby data is being collected despite multiple runs",
      "The system can 'pass' verification while delivering zero business value when data sources fail persistently",
      "Learning loop is not effectively feeding back actionable patterns - the ESPN 404 error has occurred in multiple runs without triggering alternative approaches",
      "Caching verified code is beneficial for performance but problematic when the cached code contains unresolved external dependencies",
      "Domain success requires both correct logic AND working data sources - current verification doesn't adequately weight data acquisition success"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should analyze execution logs to identify recurring external failures (like ESPN 404) and flag them as high-priority issues requiring alternative approaches",
      "REFLECT should explicitly recommend trying alternative rugby data sources: official World Rugby API, RugbyPass, Ultimate Rugby, or official SA Rugby website",
      "ACT should research and test multiple Springbok data sources before settling on one, especially given the persistent ESPN failure pattern",
      "VERIFY should include explicit criteria about data acquisition success (e.g., 'At least one new game was successfully fetched from the data source')",
      "Add a verification criterion that fails if zero games exist after multiple runs - this indicates a fundamental data source problem",
      "Consider implementing a data source health check that validates URLs and response codes before attempting full scraping",
      "LEARN phase should track patterns of external dependency failures and surface them as critical issues requiring strategic changes"
