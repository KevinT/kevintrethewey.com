    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided basic execution history but lacked critical domain guidance about the recurring 404 error pattern. Multiple logs showed the same ESPN URL failing repeatedly (iterations 1, 2, and the current run), but no strategic guidance was provided to ACT about trying alternative data sources or URL patterns.",
      "gaps": [
        "No pattern recognition that ESPN URL has consistently failed across multiple runs",
        "No alternative data sources suggested (World Rugby, official Springboks site, other sports APIs)",
        "No guidance on URL validation or exploration strategies before committing to a data source",
        "Missing context about whether the ESPN URL structure was verified or just assumed",
        "No learning captured about resilient data sourcing strategies for sports data"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT made reasonable technical decisions (proper error handling, data preservation, merge logic) but showed poor domain agency by repeatedly using a failing data source without exploring alternatives. The code was well-structured but bound to fail due to incorrect source URL.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Proper data structure design with all required fields (date, opponent, scores, scorers, player performance)",
        "Sound data preservation logic ensuring existing games are never lost",
        "Conditional coaching tips generation only when new games are detected",
        "Clear execution output with helpful status messages",
        "Robust error handling that gracefully handles fetch failures"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "No exploration of alternative data sources despite repeated 404 errors",
        "Hardcoded URL without validation or fallback mechanisms",
        "No research into correct ESPN URL format or verification that the chosen URL exists",
        "Missing agency to question the data source choice after seeing it fail in previous runs",
        "No implementation of multiple data source attempts (primary/fallback pattern)"

      "overall_passed": false,
      "key_issues": [
        "Primary goal cannot be achieved: No Springbok games can be fetched due to 404 error on ESPN URL",
        "The hardcoded ESPN URL (id/2359) returns 404 - either wrong team ID or changed URL structure",
        "Without game data, coaching tips generation cannot fulfill its purpose",
        "System is technically sound but functionally blocked by data source issue"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Fix the ESPN Scrum URL - the current URL returns a 404 error. The team ID or URL structure may have changed",
        "Add URL validation or alternative data sources as fallback. Consider trying multiple URL patterns",
        "Implement better error handling for HTTP errors with suggestions for URL correction in the output",
        "Consider adding a test mode that can validate the URL is accessible before attempting full scraping",
        "Document the expected URL format and add logging to help diagnose URL structure changes"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "The RAVL system successfully learned code structure and execution patterns, but failed to learn at the strategic domain level - it never questioned the data source choice despite repeated failures",
      "There's a gap between technical success (code executes without errors) and domain success (achieving the actual goal of tracking games). The system optimized for the former while ignoring the latter.",
      "The caching mechanism worked well for code reuse, but became a trap - it locked in a fundamentally flawed data source decision across multiple runs",
      "VERIFY correctly identified the problem and recommended code regeneration, but REFLECT didn't synthesize this into strategic guidance about data source exploration",
      "The loop demonstrates good resilience (preserving empty datasets, not creating spurious coaching tips) but lacks adaptability (trying new approaches when current approach fails)"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should explicitly flag: 'ESPN URL has failed in 3+ consecutive runs - ACT must research and validate alternative data sources before proceeding'",
      "ACT should implement a data source exploration strategy: try multiple URLs/sources (ESPN with different IDs, World Rugby API, official Springboks site, RugbyPass) and document which ones work",
      "Add a pre-flight validation step: before main execution, test that the data source URL returns 200 status",
      "Implement fallback data sources: if primary source fails, automatically try 2-3 alternative sources",
      "REFLECT should provide specific alternative sources to try based on the domain (rugby results): ESPN alternatives, World Rugby match center API, Springboks official fixtures page",
      "ACT should log discovered working URLs to learnings so future runs can start with validated sources",
      "Change verification criteria to explicitly check: 'At least one working data source was identified and used successfully'",
      "Consider manual intervention option: if automated source discovery fails, provide clear instructions for human to supply a working data source URL"
