      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context - no prior domain learnings were effectively utilized despite previous runs encountering the same 404 error. The execution_learning directory shows this is iteration 2 with known URL failures, but this wasn't surfaced as actionable context.",
      "gaps": [
        "Failed to highlight the known ESPN URL 404 issue from previous run (dsl_iteration_1 had same failure)",
        "No guidance on alternative data sources despite previous fetch failures",

      "assessment": "ACT reused cached code that was known to fail at data retrieval, showing no adaptation to previous failures. The code structure is sound (proper error handling, merge logic, conditional tips generation) but the fundamental data source problem went unaddressed.",

        "Proper preservation of existing data structure (0 games preserved correctly)",
        "Correct conditional logic for coaching tips generation (skipped when no new games)",
        "Good error handling that prevented crashes and logged the 404 issue",
        "Sound merge and deduplication logic (would work with valid data)"

        "Did not attempt alternative data sources despite known URL failure",

    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should explicitly flag 'ESPN URL has failed in previous 2 runs - MUST try alternative data source' as priority focus",
      "ACT should research and implement alternative Springbok data sources (World Rugby API, official Springboks stats, alternative ESPN URLs with correct team IDs)",
      "Add data source validation step: test URL accessibility before attempting full scrape logic",
      "Implement fallback chain: primary source (ESPN corrected) \u2192 secondary source (World Rugby) \u2192 tertiary source (official team site)",
      "Include sample/mock data as ultimate fallback to allow testing of downstream logic (coaching tips generation)",
      "Add domain learning: 'Web scraping requires URL validation and multiple source options for reliability'"
