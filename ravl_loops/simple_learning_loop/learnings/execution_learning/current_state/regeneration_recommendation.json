  "result_pattern_evidence": "Runs 2-5 all PASSED with successful explorations. Run 6 FAILED with BrokenPipe error (possibly transient). Run 7 (current) FAILED with NameError due to code logic bug (failure_types undefined). The verification scores dropped dramatically: Discovery Value 3/10, Insight Depth 2/10, Efficiency 1/10, Overall 2.0/10 (vs threshold 5.0). Code attempted to explore execution_learning but crashed before completing analysis.",
  "code_quality": "poor",
  "code_quality_rationale": "Current code has a critical variable scope bug (failure_types not initialized when execution_learning directory is empty).

  "recommend_regeneration": true,
  "rationale": "STRONG REGENERATION NEEDED for three critical reasons: (1) This is an exploratory/discovery loop designed for progressive learning - each run MUST explore different territory, but deterministic code will repeat same exploration. (2) Code has a logic bug (NameError on undefined variable) that will persist - not a transient failure. (3) This is run #7 of an exploratory loop - fresh code generation can select genuinely NEW exploration areas based on what's already in exploration_log.md and avoid repeating territory. The verification explicitly states: 'explore genuinely NEW territory' and 'choose a completely different area'. Cached code defeats the entire purpose of progressive discovery.",
