    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided comprehensive structural context (learnings directory, execution history, loop configuration) but lacked domain-specific guidance. The context showed WHAT exists but not WHAT TO EXPLORE NEXT based on cumulative learning. Skip cache was triggered but rationale was truncated, suggesting domain guidance may have been lost.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit identification of unexplored framework areas from previous runs",
        "Missing synthesis of discoveries from runs 1-4 to suggest logical next steps",
        "No prioritization of exploration areas based on cumulative knowledge gaps",
        "Domain guidance fields (priority_focus, successful_patterns) were empty despite 4 previous runs",
        "Previous run's verification suggestions not surfaced in REFLECT context"

    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated strong autonomous decision-making by analyzing previous explorations, selecting an unexplored area, and conducting systematic investigation. The code was well-structured with clear discovery enumeration and proper logging. ACT compensated for missing REFLECT guidance by self-generating exploration priorities.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Self-directed redundancy avoidance: parsed exploration_log.md to identify previously covered areas",
        "Strategic area selection: chose 'Framework execution patterns' from pre-defined list of unexplored topics",
        "Systematic investigation: examined execution_learning JSON files, extracted patterns about success/failure tracking",
        "Clear documentation: produced 6 enumerated discoveries with architectural significance",
        "Proper state management: updated exploration log, tracked run number from execution history"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "Shallow analysis depth: counted and inspected files but didn't perform comparative analysis across 4 execution attempts",
        "Missed trend analysis opportunity: didn't examine evolution of execution patterns over time",
        "Limited cross-referencing: didn't connect current discoveries to insights from previous 4 runs"

      "overall_passed": true,
      "key_issues": [
        "Discovery depth plateauing: while new area was explored (8/10), analysis remained surface-level (7/10)",
        "Efficiency limitation: prepared for deeper analysis but executed only basic examination (7/10)",
        "Pattern not yet leveraged: 4 execution attempts available but not comparatively analyzed"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Consider comparative analysis across execution attempts - look for trends in execution times, patterns in error types, or evolution in success rates",
        "When examining JSON files, extract and compare specific field values rather than just noting their presence",
        "Connect current discoveries to previous explorations - reference insights from runs 1-4 to build cumulative understanding",
        "For run #7+, explore how execution patterns relate to verification patterns (cross-cutting analysis would deepen insights)"

    "strategic_insights": [
      "PROGRESSIVE LEARNING PARADOX: This is a cumulative exploration loop (each run builds on previous), but REFLECT isn't synthesizing cumulative knowledge. ACT is compensating by self-parsing exploration logs, but this is inefficient and limits depth.",
      "EXPLORATION vs ANALYSIS GAP: Runs 1-5 focused on DISCOVERING new areas. Run 6 explored framework execution patterns but stayed at discovery level. The loop needs to shift from 'what exists' to 'what patterns mean' - analyzing trends, connections, and implications across discovered data.",
      "VERIFICATION FEEDBACK DISCONNECT: VERIFY provides specific, actionable suggestions each run (comparative analysis, extract field values, connect discoveries), but these aren't surfacing in REFLECT or being actioned by ACT in subsequent runs.",
      "SELF-DIRECTED AGENCY SUCCESS: Despite empty domain_guidance in REFLECT, ACT successfully avoided redundancy and made strategic exploration choices. This suggests the loop can self-organize, but would benefit from REFLECT synthesizing this intelligence rather than ACT re-deriving it each run.",
      "DEPTH THRESHOLD REACHED: With 5+ areas explored, the loop should transition from breadth (new areas) to depth (analyzing patterns across areas). Current design encourages new discovery over deeper analysis."

        "Surface previous VERIFY suggestions: include specific recommendations from runs 3-5 in domain_guidance.priority_focus",
        "Propose depth exploration: since breadth is covered, suggest analyzing patterns ACROSS previous discoveries (trends, correlations, architectural implications)",
