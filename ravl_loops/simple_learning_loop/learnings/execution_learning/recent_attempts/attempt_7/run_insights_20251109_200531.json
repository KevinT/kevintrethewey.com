    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context - no prior domain learnings referenced, empty domain_guidance structure. However, the loop has successfully run 6+ times with consistent patterns, suggesting context is being utilized implicitly through cached code rather than explicitly through learning artifacts.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit historical discoveries from previous 6 runs surfaced",
        "No guidance on what environment aspects have already been explored",
        "Missing patterns from successful past explorations",
        "No exploration strategy based on accumulated knowledge",
        "Empty priority_focus and successful_patterns fields despite multiple runs"

    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated strong agency by reusing verified cached code that systematically explores RAVL architecture. The exploration strategy is sophisticated - examining learning architecture, logging infrastructure, state management, configurations, and health checks in one coherent investigation. Generated 4 concrete discoveries and 3 deep insights connecting architectural patterns.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Systematic multi-dimensional exploration (learning, logging, state, config, health)",
        "Pattern synthesis connecting discoveries to architectural insights",
        "Efficient code reuse through caching (6th successful execution)",

    "strategic_insights": [
      "The loop has successfully evolved beyond basic environment exploration to meta-exploration - examining its own learning and health check infrastructure",
      "Code caching enables exploration continuity across runs without requiring REFLECT to explicitly pass context",
      "High verification scores (7.67/10 overall) indicate the exploration strategy has matured to produce deep architectural insights rather than surface facts",
      "The disconnect between empty domain_guidance in REFLECT and successful execution suggests learning is happening through execution artifacts rather than explicit knowledge transfer",
      "VERIFY suggestions point toward next-level exploration: examining actual file contents and mechanisms rather than just structure"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should surface previous exploration findings from the 6+ successful runs to avoid redundancy and guide deeper investigation",
      "ACT should follow VERIFY's suggestion to examine actual learning file contents - read sample markdown/JSON to understand pattern formats",
      "ACT should investigate the 84 LLM log files to understand how the framework makes decisions and learns from interactions",
      "ACT should explore the relationship between verification criteria and how insights get stored in learning files",
      "REFLECT should populate domain_guidance with successful exploration patterns (systematic multi-dimensional analysis, insight synthesis) to reinforce effective approaches",
      "ACT should examine health check diagnostic logic to understand how the framework categorizes and responds to failures"
