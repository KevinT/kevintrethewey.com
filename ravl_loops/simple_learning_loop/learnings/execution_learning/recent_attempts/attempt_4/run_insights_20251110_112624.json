    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided strong progressive discovery context. It included run history (#3 exploration), previous discoveries (14+ items across 6 exploration areas), and current state tracking. However, it failed to highlight what was ALREADY explored in previous runs to prevent redundancy.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit enumeration of what was already explored in runs #1-2",
        "Missing clear guidance on unexplored territories remaining",
        "No prioritization of high-value vs low-value exploration areas",
        "Didn't surface that run #3 previously failed verification for redundancy"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated strong agency by choosing a focused exploration area (execution learning patterns) and conducting systematic multi-dimensional analysis. The code was well-structured, examined 5 different artifact types, and logged discoveries appropriately. This resulted in 8/10 discovery value and 7/10 insight depth.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Focused on framework infrastructure patterns rather than redundant basic facts",
        "Multi-dimensional analysis across execution_learning, state, logs, and outputs",
        "Pattern recognition (error diversity, state growth trends, separation of concerns)",
        "Connected observations into meta-insights about framework architecture",
        "Efficient file enumeration and sampling rather than exhaustive reading"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "Didn't deeply analyze actual error content from execution learning files",
        "Only sampled log file beginnings rather than extracting behavioral patterns",
        "Mentioned loop_learning directory but didn't explore it",
        "Could have compared state snapshots to understand knowledge evolution"
      ]

      "overall_passed": true,
      "key_issues": [
        "Exploration efficiency scored only 6/10 due to shallow sampling",
        "Opportunities missed for deeper analysis of available data"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Analyze actual error content from execution_learning files to identify common failure modes",
        "Compare state snapshots across runs to understand knowledge accumulation patterns",
        "Analyze log file content patterns to understand framework behavior during different phases",
        "Explore loop_learning directory for domain-specific learnings",
        "Examine relationships between execution failures and subsequent recoveries"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Progressive discovery loops need explicit anti-redundancy mechanisms - REFLECT should track explored vs unexplored territory boundaries",
      "Framework meta-exploration (understanding infrastructure) appears valuable early but should transition to domain exploration (loop_learning content) by run #3-4",
      "Sampling vs deep analysis trade-off: current approach favors breadth (5 areas touched) over depth (shallow examination), but VERIFY suggests depth would provide more value",
      "The loop's own verification criteria (Discovery Value, Insight Depth, Efficiency) create a useful feedback mechanism that clearly identified the shallow sampling issue",
      "Regeneration recommendation pattern suggests exploratory loops should shift focus areas across runs rather than repeating similar investigations"

    "recommendations_for_next_run": {
      "for_reflect": [
        "Explicitly enumerate what territories were explored in runs #1-4 to prevent redundancy",
        "Highlight unexplored or under-explored areas: loop_learning content, error pattern analysis, state evolution tracking",
        "Provide guidance that run #4+ should focus on domain content (loop_learning) rather than infrastructure (execution_learning, logs)",
        "Surface VERIFY's specific suggestions as priority focus areas"
      ],
      "for_act": [
        "Choose loop_learning directory as next exploration target - the domain-specific learnings not yet examined",
        "Conduct deeper analysis rather than breadth sampling - analyze actual content not just enumerate structure",
        "Compare temporal evolution: examine how loop_learning or state files changed across runs",
        "Extract actionable patterns from error content or verification failures to understand what makes explorations succeed/fail"
