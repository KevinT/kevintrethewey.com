      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal guidance for progressive exploration. Context showed previous run history but lacked explicit direction on what aspects had already been explored vs. what remained unexplored. The loop spec prompts for progressive discovery (< 3 runs: basics, 3-7: structure, 7+: deep investigation) but REFLECT didn't track which stage the exploration was in.",
      "gaps": [
        "No inventory of what has already been discovered across previous runs",
        "No explicit stage tracking (run count: 7+ means deep investigation phase)",
        "No identification of unexplored areas vs. redundantly explored areas",

      "assessment": "ACT executed cached code without awareness that this violated the exploratory loop's requirement for progressive discovery. The code repeated identical directory-structure exploration from previous runs, ignoring that 7+ runs means deep investigation phase.

      "Exploratory loops fundamentally conflict with code caching - each iteration requires different exploration focus, but caching executes identical operations",

      "The loop spec's stage-based progression (< 3: basics, 3-7: structure, 7+: deep) is not being tracked or enforced",

      "REFLECT must track exploration history: maintain explicit inventory of what aspects have been explored (directory structure \u2713, file contents \u2717, code patterns \u2717)",
      "REFLECT must identify current stage based on run count: Run 8 = deep investigation phase, focus should be analyzing actual content of discovered artifacts",
      "REFLECT must explicitly flag: 'Previous runs explored directory structure. This run should analyze FILE CONTENTS from 85 LLM logs or examine health-check artifact implementations'",
      "ACT must generate fresh exploration code targeting unexplored aspects: read sample LLM log files, parse health-check markdown, or trace code execution patterns",
      "VERIFY recommendation for code regeneration must flow back to REFLECT as 'cached code caused repetition' context for next run",
      "Disable code caching for exploratory loops or implement cache invalidation when exploration territory should shift",
