    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context - empty domain_guidance fields and no historical learnings accumulated. The loop instructions were clear about exploration strategy (time/context \u2192 structure \u2192 deep investigation), but no previous discoveries were surfaced to avoid redundancy or build upon.",
      "gaps": [
        "No indication of what has been explored in previous runs",
        "No accumulated knowledge base from prior explorations",
        "Empty priority_focus and successful_patterns fields",
        "No exploration count to guide decision-making (< 3 runs vs 3-7 vs 7+)",

    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated excellent domain agency by independently choosing to explore RAVL's framework architecture rather than just immediate environment. Made sophisticated decision to examine the learning system itself - showing meta-awareness of operating within a learning framework. Code was well-structured, systematic, and extracted meaningful patterns.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Self-directed exploration of framework architecture without explicit instruction",
        "Systematic examination of 5 key areas (learning, logging, state, configs, health)",

    "strategic_insights": [
      "Loop exhibits emergent meta-awareness: ACT chose to explore the learning framework itself rather than just executing prescribed exploration areas",
      "High-quality exploration possible even with minimal REFLECT context - agency can compensate for sparse guidance",
      "Loop instructions emphasize progressive depth (basics \u2192 structure \u2192 investigation) but actual exploration jumped directly to sophisticated framework analysis",
      "Verification criteria effectively measure discovery value, insight depth, and efficiency separately before aggregating",
