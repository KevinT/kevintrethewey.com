    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context for a first run - empty context_vars, no historical learnings, and unpopulated domain_guidance. However, this is appropriate for an exploratory loop's initial run where the goal is foundational discovery. The ravl_loop.md instructions were clear about exploration strategy.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit run count or execution history visible to ACT",
        "No indication of what 'basics' have been covered in previous runs (though this was run #1)",
        "Empty domain_guidance meant ACT had to infer exploration priorities from ravl_loop.md alone"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated excellent meta-cognitive agency by recognizing this was a foundational run and choosing to explore the loop's own structure rather than attempting premature domain exploration. The code systematically examined 6 key areas to understand the learning environment before diving into domain work.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Strategic choice to perform meta-exploration first (understanding the loop before exploring domain)",
        "Comprehensive discovery of verification criteria (3 dimensions, scoring thresholds)",
        "Recognition of state persistence mechanisms (exploration_log.md as cumulative memory)",
        "Clear documentation of 9 specific discoveries with significance analysis",
        "Code generated proper exploration log entry following the prescribed format"

    "verification_outcomes": {
      "overall_passed": true,
      "key_issues": [
        "VERIFY recognized that while Run #1 meta-exploration was excellent (7.67/10), repeating it would violate the 'genuinely new' principle",
        "Cache reuse warning: exploratory loops fundamentally require code regeneration to avoid deterministic repetition"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Future runs should shift from meta-exploration to domain exploration",
        "Consider exploring domain-specific data sources or files in the loop directory",
        "Examine actual content patterns in existing logs/state files",
        "Look for domain knowledge or example data to guide next explorations"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Exploratory loops have a natural progression: meta-exploration (understand the environment) \u2192 domain exploration (discover facts) \u2192 deep investigation (connect patterns)",
      "The verification criteria explicitly penalizes redundant exploration, making code regeneration essential between runs",
      "The exploration_log.md serves as the loop's memory - each run should check it to avoid redundancy and identify knowledge gaps",
      "Run counting mechanism (checking existing log entries) provides self-awareness about exploration stage",
      "Success threshold of 5.0/10 is intentionally low to encourage experimental exploration while still requiring meaningful discovery"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should parse exploration_log.md to populate domain_guidance with what's already known and what gaps remain",
      "REFLECT should explicitly state the run number and map it to exploration strategy (basics/structure/deep-dive)",
      "ACT should explore actual domain content: check for data files, configuration examples, or domain patterns in the loop directory",
      "ACT should explicitly reference prior discoveries from exploration_log.md to demonstrate building on previous knowledge",
      "Consider exploring: Python environment details (sys.version, platform), available libraries (imports), or filesystem patterns beyond the learnings directory",
      "Each exploration should aim for 7+ quality scores by seeking connections between discoveries, not just listing facts"
