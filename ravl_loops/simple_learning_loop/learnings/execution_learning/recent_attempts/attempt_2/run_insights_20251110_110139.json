      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context - empty domain_guidance with no priority focus, successful patterns, or failed patterns. The only guidance was to skip cache for exploratory purposes. This left ACT without strategic direction about what domain territory to explore.",
      "gaps": [
        "No explicit exploration priority beyond 'something new'",
        "No indication of what domain knowledge already exists in exploration_log.md",
        "No guidance distinguishing infrastructure vs domain exploration",
        "Missing clarity on the loop's actual PURPOSE or domain focus area",
        "No historical context about Run 1's discoveries to avoid repetition"

    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT made reasonable infrastructure-discovery choices but failed to distinguish meta-framework exploration from domain exploration. The code systematically analyzed RAVL structure (config files, directories, env vars) which is useful for orientation but doesn't advance domain understanding. ACT lacked strategic awareness of what constitutes valuable 'new territory' for Run 2+.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Systematic approach to exploration with clear categorization of discoveries",
        "Generated insights connecting facts into patterns (not just listing facts)",

      "what_failed": [
        "Explored framework infrastructure instead of domain content",
        "Did not read existing exploration_log.md to understand what Run 1 already discovered",
        "Did not identify or pursue the loop's actual domain purpose",
        "No differentiation between orientation (Run 1) and ongoing exploration (Run 2+)",

        "Exploration focused on meta/framework level rather than domain content",

      "suggestions": [
        "Run 2 should shift focus to domain/problem-space exploration",
        "Explore actual data/content in current_state files or domain patterns in existing learnings",
        "Read the loop's PURPOSE or GOAL from ravl.yml to guide domain-specific exploration",
        "Build on infrastructure foundation by exploring what the loop is meant to LEARN about",
        "Explore NEW territory, not re-analyze the same infrastructure"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "The loop is experiencing a meta-exploration trap: Run 2 explored the exploration framework itself rather than using the framework to explore domain content",
      "REFLECT's empty domain_guidance creates a strategic vacuum where ACT defaults to analyzing its own infrastructure",
      "VERIFY correctly identified the fundamental issue: exploratory loops need progressive discovery, but the code was deterministic",
      "There's a critical distinction missing between orientation (understanding the framework) and operation (using the framework to explore domain)",
      "The loop needs explicit guidance about its domain focus area - what is it meant to discover beyond its own structure?"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT must read exploration_log.md to understand what has already been discovered and provide explicit next exploration priority",
      "REFLECT should identify the loop's actual domain purpose from ravl.yml or loop documentation and include it in priority_focus",
      "REFLECT should explicitly distinguish infrastructure concerns from domain concerns in context preparation",
      "ACT should begin by checking exploration_log.md for run history and adapting exploration strategy based on what's already known",
      "ACT should focus exploration on domain content: read ravl_loop.md files to understand the intended exploration subject matter",
      "ACT should implement progressive exploration logic: if Run N, then explore aspect X (not repeat aspect A)",
      "VERIFY criteria should explicitly penalize redundant exploration more heavily to discourage repetition"
