    "context_quality": {
      "assessment": "REFLECT provided minimal context - no prior domain learnings were effectively surfaced despite 5+ previous runs existing (evidenced by log files). The empty domain_guidance structure suggests context preparation is not capturing or propagating learning from previous iterations.",
      "gaps": [
        "No exploration history from previous 5 runs to avoid redundant discovery",
        "Missing previously discovered facts about the environment",
        "No guidance on what areas have already been explored vs unexplored territory",
        "Empty successful_patterns and failed_patterns despite multiple prior runs",
        "No context about the 'Environment Explorer' loop's cumulative knowledge"
      ]
    },
    "agency_effectiveness": {
      "assessment": "ACT demonstrated strong agency by choosing to explore RAVL's internal architecture (learning systems, logging, health checks) - a meta-cognitive approach examining the framework itself. The execution was thorough, systematic, and generated concrete discoveries with meaningful insights.",
      "what_worked": [
        "Systematic multi-dimensional exploration (learning dirs, logs, state, configs, health checks)",
        "Concrete quantitative discoveries (83 LLM logs, 14 health artifacts)",
        "Generated architectural insights connecting discoveries to framework design principles",
        "Efficient code reuse (cached code from previous run executed successfully)",
        "Clear output formatting with discoveries and insights separated"
      ],
      "what_failed": [
        "Did not append to output/exploration_log.md as instructed by the ravl_loop.md specification",
        "Missing the required format with 'Run {number}' header tracking iteration count",
        "No explicit connection to 'Environment Explorer' concept - explored framework internals rather than execution environment"
      ]
    },
    "verification_outcomes": {
      "overall_passed": true,
      "key_issues": [
        "Exploration focused on framework architecture rather than execution environment per loop's stated purpose",
        "Output format deviated from specified append-to-log structure",
        "Potential confusion between 'environment exploration' and 'framework introspection'"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Sample actual learning file contents to understand pattern extraction",
        "Examine health check script logic for diagnostic implementations",
        "Investigate relationship between 83 LLM logs and learning systems",
        "Explore why execution_learning and loop_learning directories appear empty"
      ]
    },
    "strategic_insights": [
      "Loop experiencing identity drift: designed as 'Environment Explorer' but acting as 'Framework Introspection Tool' - this suggests unclear or evolving purpose",
      "Strong code caching working well - same exploration code reused across multiple runs with consistent success",
      "Learning accumulation gap: 5+ successful runs but REFLECT shows no prior learnings - suggests LEARN phase may not be feeding back into REFLECT effectively",
      "High-quality meta-exploration: examining the learning system itself demonstrates sophisticated agency but may not align with intended loop purpose"
    ],
    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should explicitly surface cumulative discoveries from all previous runs to avoid redundant exploration",
      "Clarify loop purpose: if exploring execution environment (time, filesystem, system), focus there; if exploring framework architecture, update loop definition accordingly",
      "ACT should follow the specified output format (append to exploration_log.md with run number header) for proper knowledge accumulation",
      "Investigate the LEARN\u2192REFLECT feedback loop: why aren't previous run insights appearing in domain_guidance?",
      "Consider exploring one of VERIFY's suggestions (e.g., sample learning file contents) rather than repeating framework structure discovery",
      "Track run number explicitly to understand exploration progression and avoid circular exploration patterns"
