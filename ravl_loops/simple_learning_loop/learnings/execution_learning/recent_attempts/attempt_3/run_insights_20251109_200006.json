        "Self-directed focus on framework architecture rather than trivial facts",

    "strategic_insights": [
      "The loop is successfully building architectural knowledge layer-by-layer: Run 1 likely covered basics, Run 2 likely expanded, Run 3 (current) explored sophisticated framework patterns",
      "High verification scores (8/9/7) indicate the exploration quality is improving - the agent is learning what constitutes valuable discovery vs redundant checking",
      "Cached code reuse (code_hash: 7ffc3880) suggests a stable, working exploration pattern that can be leveraged repeatedly",
      "The 4 discoveries + 3 insights pattern shows effective synthesis - not just collecting facts but connecting them into understanding",
      "VERIFY's suggestions indicate clear next steps for deepening exploration, creating a natural progression path"

    "recommendations_for_next_run": [
      "REFLECT should incorporate the 4 discoveries and 3 insights from this run to avoid redundant exploration of learning architecture",
      "REFLECT should present VERIFY's specific suggestions as priority focus areas: sample learning file contents, examine health check scripts, analyze LLM logs",
      "REFLECT should indicate this is Run 3+ territory - time for deep investigation rather than surface mapping",
      "ACT should follow VERIFY's guidance to examine actual file contents and executable scripts for deeper understanding of mechanisms",
      "ACT should explore the relationship between the 80 LLM log files and learning outcomes to understand how the framework learns from interactions",
      "Future explorations should maintain the synthesis approach - connecting findings into insights rather than just listing facts"
