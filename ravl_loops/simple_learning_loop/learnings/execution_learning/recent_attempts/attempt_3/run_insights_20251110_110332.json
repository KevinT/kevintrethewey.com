      "assessment": "REFLECT provided good meta-context but failed to guide progressive exploration. While it correctly identified this as a discovery loop requiring novelty, it didn't provide concrete guidance on what remains unexplored after runs #1-2, nor did it enforce novelty checking against previous discoveries.",

        "No explicit tracking of what was already explored in runs #1-2",
        "No guidance on specific unexplored areas to target in run #3",

      "assessment": "ACT failed to demonstrate novelty-seeking agency. It generated code that mechanically re-examined the same static structures (config files, directory counts) that would have been covered in earlier runs, without leveraging previous context or seeking genuinely new insights.",

        "Didn't analyze actual learning content or patterns across runs",
