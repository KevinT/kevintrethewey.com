## Explore Your Chosen Area

Based on your reflection, explore one aspect of your environment.

**Your exploration should**:
- Discover concrete facts (not generate or create)
- Document what you find clearly
- Focus on your chosen area

**Save your findings to**: `output/exploration_log.md` (append mode)

**Format your entry as**:
```
## Run {number} - {date}
**Exploring**: {what you chose to explore}
**Method**: {how you're investigating}

### Discoveries:
- {specific fact 1}
- {specific fact 2}
- {interesting observation}

### Significance:
{Why these discoveries matter or what they reveal}
```

Remember: You're an explorer mapping unknown territory. Each run adds to your map.
