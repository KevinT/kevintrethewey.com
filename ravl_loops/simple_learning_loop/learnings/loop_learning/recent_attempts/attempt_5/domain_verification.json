      "explanation": "The exploration revealed genuinely new information about RAVL's architecture. Key discoveries include: dual learning system (execution_learning vs loop_learning), 82 LLM log files indicating substantial usage history, 14 health-check artifacts showing built-in diagnostic capabilities, and the absence of loop configuration files (suggesting this is a minimal/early installation). These are concrete, actionable findings rather than redundant exploration."

      "passed": true,
      "score": 9,
      "explanation": "The exploration went well beyond surface facts to extract meaningful patterns. Notable insights: (1) Connected the dual directory structure to separation of concerns between infrastructure and domain learning, (2) Identified the hybrid human-machine learning format combining markdown context with JSON structure, (3) Recognized that multi-category logging enables observable execution for health checks, (4) Synthesized these into understanding RAVL as a 'learning system with self-improvement capabilities' rather than just a loop framework. This demonstrates pattern recognition and connection-building across discoveries."

      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration made excellent use of its scope by: (1) Systematically examining five distinct aspects of the framework (learning architecture, logging, state management, loop configs, health checks), (2) Sampling actual file content to understand formats, (3) Generating actionable 'next exploration opportunities', (4) Persisting findings to exploration_log.md for future reference. The code was focused and avoided unnecessary operations. Could have examined actual learning file contents for even deeper insights, but overall very efficient."
