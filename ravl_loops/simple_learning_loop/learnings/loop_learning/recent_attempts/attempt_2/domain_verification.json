      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration uncovered genuinely new and useful information about RAVL's architecture. It discovered the dual learning system (execution_learning vs loop_learning), multi-category logging infrastructure, health check artifacts, and the hybrid markdown/JSON learning format. These are concrete, actionable discoveries that weren't obvious from the surface, not redundant territory."

    {
      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration went well beyond surface-level facts. It identified architectural patterns like 'Separation of Concerns in Learning', connected the dual storage format to enabling both human and machine learning, and recognized how the logging infrastructure supports health diagnostics. The insight about 'Targeted Improvement' shows understanding of how the system's design enables self-improvement. These are meaningful connections between discovered facts."

      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "The exploration made effective use of the attempt by systematically examining multiple aspects: learning directories, logging infrastructure, state management, loop configurations, and health check artifacts. The output includes concrete 'Next Exploration Opportunities' showing awareness of what could be explored deeper. Could have sampled actual learning file contents for even more depth, but overall very efficient use of the exploration cycle."

It systematically examined the RAVL framework structure, discovered concrete architectural patterns, and generated meaningful insights. The exploration log was properly created with rich context. There are no execution failures, logic errors, or repeated failure patterns. The code is working as designed and meeting the verification criteria with a score of 7.67/10, well above the 5.0 threshold. No regeneration needed.",
