      "explanation": "The exploration discovered genuinely useful structural information: 15 config files, 3 Python files, 5 learning subdirectories, and environment variable setup. While this is foundational knowledge (Run 1), it's valuable for understanding the loop's context. However, this is infrastructure discovery rather than domain-specific discovery - it learned about the RAVL framework itself rather than the problem domain the loop is meant to explore."

      "explanation": "Generated 4 meaningful insights that connect discoveries into patterns: recognized the exploratory nature from configuration, understood the framework's abstraction model (env vars for isolation), and identified the learning persistence structure. These go beyond surface facts to explain 'why' things are organized this way. However, insights remain at the meta/framework level rather than deeper domain patterns."

      "score": 6,
      "explanation": "Made reasonable use of the exploration by systematically analyzing 4 aspects: loop directory structure, RAVL config, learning directory structure, and environment setup. Created a well-structured log with 9 discoveries and 4 insights. However, explored only framework/infrastructure - could have begun exploring actual domain content or problem space. Efficiency is good for orientation but doesn't advance domain understanding."

Run 1 explored framework infrastructure. For Run 2+, cached code would repeat the same infrastructure analysis, violating the loop's fundamental purpose of discovering something NEW each run. Fresh code generation is required to explore different aspects (domain content, actual learnings, problem space) rather than re-executing the same deterministic exploration. The code lacks adaptive exploration logic that would change behavior based on run history.",
