      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration uncovered genuinely new information about RAVL's dual learning architecture (execution_learning vs loop_learning separation), health check infrastructure (14 artifacts found), and logging system (80 LLM log files). This goes beyond surface-level 'file exists' checks to understand the framework's architectural patterns."

    {
      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 9,
      "explanation": "Excellent depth - the exploration connected multiple facts to form coherent insights: (1) Dual learning system separates infrastructure from domain concerns, (2) Hybrid markdown+JSON format enables both human and machine learning, (3) Multi-category logging enables observable execution. These are architectural insights, not just surface facts."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "Good efficiency - systematically examined learning directories, logging infrastructure, state management, loop configs, and health check systems. Generated both concrete discoveries (4 facts) and synthesized insights (3 key patterns). Could have sampled actual learning file contents for even deeper understanding, but covered major architectural components effectively."

      "criterion": "Overall Score",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8.0,
      "explanation": "(Discovery Value: 8 + Insight Depth: 9 + Exploration Efficiency: 7) / 3 = 8.0. Well exceeds the 5.0 success threshold. This exploration delivered significant value by revealing RAVL's sophisticated learning architecture and separation of concerns between execution and domain learning."

The exploration systematically examined framework architecture and synthesized valuable insights about dual learning systems. No code issues detected; this is a successful domain-quality outcome that meets all verification criteria with high scores.",
