      "explanation": "The insights are mostly surface-level facts (file counts, directory structure, file sizes). While there's some synthesis in the 'significance' section, it doesn't reveal deeper patterns or connections that wouldn't be obvious from basic directory inspection. The 'key insight' acknowledges this is a discovery loop but doesn't actually discover anything new about the domain."

      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Poor efficiency for run #3. The code is spending effort re-examining static configuration and directory structure that was already mapped in previous runs. No use of previous context to guide exploration toward unexplored areas. The code loads 'previous_context' but doesn't actually use it to avoid redundant discovery."

    "Move from static structure analysis to dynamic behavior analysis - how do files change over time? What patterns emerge in the logs? What do the actual learnings reveal?",
    "Implement explicit novelty checking: before exploring something, verify it hasn't been explored in previous runs. Focus effort on gaps in knowledge.",
    "Consider exploring relationships and correlations: How do execution learnings relate to loop learnings? What triggers state changes? What patterns exist in the exploration log itself?"

  "recommend_code_regeneration": true,
  "regeneration_rationale": "This is an EXPLORATORY/DISCOVERY loop (run #3) where 'each run should explore something NEW', but the current execution shows it's using cached/repeated logic that re-examines the same static structure. The context explicitly warns 'Exploratory loops fundamentally conflict with code caching.' The code is deterministic and will produce redundant discoveries on each run. Fresh code generation is needed to implement progressive discovery that builds on runs #1-2 and explores genuinely new territory (e.g., content analysis, pattern detection, behavioral insights) rather than re-mapping the same directory structure.",
