      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration discovered genuinely new information about RAVL's architecture: dual learning system (execution_learning vs loop_learning separation), logging infrastructure (84 LLM log files), health check binaries, and state management patterns. This goes beyond superficial facts to reveal architectural patterns not evident from basic usage."

    {
      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "Generated deep insights connecting multiple discoveries: (1) Separation of concerns between infrastructure and domain learning enables independent improvement, (2) Hybrid human-machine learning format combining markdown context with JSON structure, (3) Multi-dimensional logging enabling observable execution. These insights explain WHY the architecture matters, not just WHAT exists."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "Made good use of exploration by systematically examining multiple framework dimensions (learning, logging, state, config, health checks) and synthesizing findings into actionable insights. Could have been slightly more efficient by examining actual file contents for deeper patterns, but covered significant ground effectively."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Overall Score",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7.67,
      "explanation": "(8 + 8 + 7) / 3 = 7.67, which significantly exceeds the success threshold of 5.0. The exploration successfully learned worthwhile information about RAVL's learning architecture and health check systems."

  "overall_passed": true,
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider examining actual learning file contents to understand pattern extraction mechanisms",
    "Could analyze specific health check diagnostic logic to see how failures are categorized",
    "Might investigate the relationship between verification criteria and learning storage to understand the feedback loop",
    "Could explore how the 84 LLM log files relate to framework decision-making and self-improvement"

  "recommend_code_regeneration": false,
  "regeneration_rationale": "Code is executing successfully and accomplishing its exploration objective well. The output demonstrates strong discovery value (8/10), deep insights (8/10), and good efficiency (7/10), exceeding the threshold. Recent execution history shows consistent success across 5 attempts. No code logic issues evident - the exploration strategy is sound and producing valuable learning about RAVL's architecture. Regeneration would not improve outcomes since current approach is working as designed.",
