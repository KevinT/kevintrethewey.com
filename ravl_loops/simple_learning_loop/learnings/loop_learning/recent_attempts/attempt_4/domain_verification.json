      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration discovered genuinely new information about RAVL's dual learning system (execution_learning vs loop_learning), logging infrastructure (81 LLM log files), health check artifacts (14 items), and the absence of loop configuration files in the current setup. This is valuable territory that wasn't redundantly explored."

      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "The exploration went beyond surface facts to generate meaningful insights: (1) Dual learning architecture separates infrastructure from domain concerns, (2) Hybrid human-machine learning format combines markdown and JSON, (3) Observable execution through multi-category logging. These are pattern-level insights with connections between facts, though could go deeper into HOW these systems interact."

    {
      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration made excellent use of effort by systematically examining 5 key areas (learning architecture, logging, state management, loop configs, health checks) and generating structured discoveries (4 concrete facts) plus actionable insights (3 key insights). The output includes clear next exploration opportunities, showing efficient knowledge building."

      "score": 7.67,
      "explanation": "(8 + 7 + 8) / 3 = 7.67, which exceeds the success threshold of 5.0. The exploration learned something genuinely worthwhile about RAVL's learning architecture and health check infrastructure."

    "Next exploration could examine actual learning file contents to understand pattern extraction mechanisms",

  "regeneration_rationale": "Code is working perfectly as designed. All 3 attempts succeeded with consistent, valuable output. The exploration systematically discovered framework architecture details, generated meaningful insights, and created a well-structured learning log. This is exactly what exploration code should do - there are no logic errors, failures, or issues to fix. The code is cached and stable across runs, indicating mature, correct implementation.",
