      "explanation": "This exploration examined framework infrastructure patterns - execution learning files, state persistence, logging, and organizational structure. These are genuinely new discoveries compared to run #1, which would have established initial baseline. The discoveries about error tracking, state growth patterns, and separation of concerns represent real learning about the framework's architecture."

      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "Goes beyond surface facts to identify patterns: error type diversity analysis, state size growth trends indicating knowledge accumulation, and most importantly, the meta-insight about separation of concerns between execution_learning vs loop_learning. The connection between multiple output formats and varied deliverables shows pattern recognition. However, could go deeper into analyzing actual error patterns or state evolution trends."

      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 6,
      "explanation": "The exploration makes reasonable use of available data by examining multiple aspects (execution failures, state persistence, logs, outputs). However, it only samples log files (first 10 lines) and doesn't deeply analyze actual error content or state evolution. Could have extracted more insights from the 4 execution learning files beyond just counting unique error types."

      "explanation": "(8 + 7 + 6) / 3 = 7.0. This exceeds the success threshold of 5.0. The exploration provides worthwhile learning about framework infrastructure and organizational patterns."

While the current run succeeded and provided valuable insights, this loop is designed to explore different aspects each run. The execution history shows code is being regenerated each attempt (not cached), which is correct. However, to continue progressive discovery for run #3, fresh code should be generated to explore NEW territory - perhaps loop_learning patterns, deeper error analysis, or cross-directory relationships that weren't covered in runs #1-2. Exploratory loops require fresh code to avoid repeating the same deterministic exploration.",
