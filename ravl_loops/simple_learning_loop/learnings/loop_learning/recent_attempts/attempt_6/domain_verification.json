      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration discovered genuinely new information about RAVL's architecture: dual learning system (execution_learning vs loop_learning), multi-category logging (83 LLM log files), health check infrastructure (14 artifacts including bins and docs), and state management patterns. These are concrete discoveries about the framework's internal structure, not redundant exploration."

      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The output goes beyond surface facts to generate meaningful insights: (1) Separation of concerns between infrastructure and domain learning enables independent improvement, (2) Hybrid human-machine learning format combines markdown context with JSON structure, (3) Observable execution through multi-category logging enables diagnostic capabilities. These insights connect discoveries to explain *why* the architecture matters."

      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "The exploration efficiently examined multiple dimensions (learning dirs, logging, state management, configs, health checks) in a single pass. It extracted concrete numbers (83 log files, 14 health artifacts, 1 log category) and generated 3 substantial insights. Could potentially have sampled actual learning file contents for even deeper understanding, but made good use of the exploration scope."

      "score": 7.67,
      "explanation": "(8 + 8 + 7) / 3 = 7.67, which exceeds the success threshold of 5.0. The exploration learned something genuinely worthwhile about RAVL's learning architecture and health check systems."

This is working code that successfully explores and documents the RAVL framework structure. No logic issues or repeated failures present - the cached code is performing well.",
