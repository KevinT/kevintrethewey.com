      "explanation": "The exploration learned genuinely new information about the loop's structure, configuration, and learning mechanisms. This was the first run, so the meta-exploration of the loop itself (understanding verification criteria, logging mechanisms, state tracking) represents valuable foundational knowledge. Not a 10 because it's somewhat meta rather than domain exploration, but highly valuable for informing future runs."

      "score": 7,
      "explanation": "The exploration went beyond surface-level facts ('file exists') to identify patterns and connections: (1) Recognized the multi-dimensional quality scoring system, (2) Connected the exploration_log.md to cumulative learning, (3) Identified the meta-nature of this first run as foundational, (4) Analyzed how state persistence prevents redundant work. The 'Significance' section synthesizes 5 key architectural insights about the loop's learning strategy."

      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "Excellent use of this first exploration. The code systematically examined 6 key aspects (config, learnings structure, history, ACT phase, VERIFY phase, model). This meta-exploration provides a strong foundation for future domain explorations by understanding what the loop expects and how to structure discoveries. Could potentially have explored one more area (e.g., example domain data if any exists), hence 8 not 10."

The verification criteria emphasize 'Did you learn something genuinely new?' and penalize 'redundantly explore known territory'. While Run #1 succeeded excellently at meta-exploration, the CACHED CODE will repeat the exact same meta-exploration on Run #2. For true progressive discovery, fresh code must be generated to explore different aspects (domain data, historical patterns, or new areas). Exploratory loops fundamentally require code regeneration between runs to avoid deterministic repetition.",
