      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration discovered genuinely new information about RAVL's architecture: the dual learning system (execution_learning vs loop_learning), hybrid storage format (markdown + JSON), multi-category logging infrastructure (78 LLM log files), and 14 health-check related artifacts. These are concrete, non-obvious findings about the framework's internal structure, not just surface-level observations."

    {
      "criterion": "Insight Depth (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 9,
      "explanation": "The exploration went well beyond surface facts to generate deep insights: (1) Separation of concerns between solution space (execution) and problem space (domain) failures enables independent improvement, (2) Hybrid human-machine learning format serves dual purposes (LLM reasoning + programmatic checks), (3) Observable execution through logging enables diagnostic capabilities. These insights connect multiple discoveries into coherent patterns about the framework's design philosophy."

    {
      "criterion": "Exploration Efficiency (0-10)",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "The exploration systematically examined 5 key areas (learning architecture, logging, state management, loop configs, health checks) in a single pass, extracting maximum value from each area. The code discovered 4 concrete facts and generated 3 synthesized insights. It also produced actionable next steps for future exploration. Could have examined actual file contents for deeper patterns, but efficiently covered breadth first."

      "criterion": "Overall Score",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 8.3,
      "explanation": "(Discovery Value: 8 + Insight Depth: 9 + Exploration Efficiency: 8) / 3 = 8.3. This exceeds the success threshold of 5.0 significantly. The exploration successfully learned something worthwhile about RAVL's learning architecture and health check infrastructure."

    "Future explorations could sample actual learning file contents to understand pattern extraction mechanisms",
    "Could analyze health check logic/code to understand diagnostic algorithms",

    "Could trace the verification criteria system to understand how it drives learning storage decisions"

  "recommend_code_regeneration": false,
  "regeneration_rationale": "The code executed successfully and achieved its exploration objectives with high scores across all criteria (8.3 overall). The discoveries are substantive, insights are deep, and efficiency is high. There are no code logic issues, failures, or problems to fix. The exploration accomplished exactly what it was designed to do - systematically examine RAVL's internal structure and generate meaningful insights about its learning architecture. Regeneration would not improve outcomes.",
