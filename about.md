If you would like to know more about my professional career, [LinkedIn] is a good place to start.

I have quite an active [twitter account] where I tweet what I am thinking about or interested in. This is usually things around the work I do, and things I am trying to understand in relation to how work works in the organisations I am involved in.

Outside of work related things, I'm a very involved and committed father to two young boys, and husband to a [wonderful wife and mother][shanaaz] (who is also my [business partner][driven]).

I'm always interested in understanding how things work, and building or growing things. My regular interests include: reading books, marine reef aquariums, motorbikes, growing trees, gardening, camping, coding, walking, scuba diving, swimming, engines, woodwork, metalwork, cultures, language, philosophy, travel. The more of these I can combine with time with my family, the happier I tend to be.
