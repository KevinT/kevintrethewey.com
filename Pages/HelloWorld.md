<h4>Personally</h4>

This page isn't long enough to describe the list of things I am interested in outside of my professional working life (and there isn't really a clear distinction anyway).

I'm a happy family man, with a wife who is my partner in everything, including my business. Father of two boys. On any given day I could be spending time woodworking, developing a new software product idea, digging in the garden, soldering something, out on my mountain bike or deep in a book - usually with my sons in tow.

<h4>Professionally</h4>

I'm a founding member of Driven Alliance in Johannesburg, South Africa.

I have a strong technical background after almost 15 years in the software industry at almost every level from tea boy to management (and back again).

In this time I have had the opportunity to work in and observe projects and teams in vastly different environments, and seen vastly differing levels of success amongst them and through this I've developed an eye for what works and what doesn't, and a passion for assisting and empowering people.

These days I split my time between growing Driven and consulting to large organisations, helping people to understand the deeper principles behind "how the work works".


<h4>Reading List</h4>
If you would like to see what is currently in my reading list, check out <a href="www.librarything.com/catalog/KevinTrethewey">my LibraryThing catalog</a>. If there are any books in that list that you would like to borrow, then just let me know. I am always happy to loan books out to people who will read them.
