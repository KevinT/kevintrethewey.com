[Episode #232 - Kevin Trethewey on his extreme programming journey](https://devjourney.info/Guests/232-KevinTrethewey)

Tim hosts the [DevJourney](https://devjourney.info/) podcast, with the main theme of having an open ended conversation with someone who's made a career from being a software developer.

Blurb from Tim on our convo...

> Kevin started his story in the 80 & the 90s but quickly said, "Coding found me more than I found it." We then discussed his (very early) Bootcamp and how he went from one job to the next, slowly feeling less incompetent. We talked about ADHD, networking, people & organizational problems, and environment variables. We then dug our heels into eXtreme Programming and the Spine model: Needs, Values, Principles, Practices, and Tools, and how it helps us create better teams and organizations.

The episodes of the podcast include some fascinating people with very interesting stories, I felt it was a privileged to be added to the list.
