  AI and agentic agents run on data and context. Most organizations treat data as a technical problem to be solved by IT. The real challenge—and opportunity—lies in understanding it as a sociotechnical system that requires intentional organizational design.

Building on previous posts about [functional specialization]({% post_url 2025-03-21-1-functional-specialisation-cost %}) and [agentic AI]({% post_url 2025-03-21-2-agentic-ai-challenges-to-traditional-org-design %}), let's explore how the way we organize around data will become a primary differentiator between companies that thrive and those that struggle in the age of ambient intelligence.

## The Traditional Approach Is Failing

Most organizations still treat data as primarily a technical challenge:
- They hire data engineers and architects
- They buy data platforms and tools
- They create data strategies focused on storage, processing, and analytics

But they're missing the fundamental point: **Data is a sociotechnical artifact**. It's continually created, modified, and consumed through human interactions, decisions, and organizational processes.

And in a world where increasingly intelligent agents are acting on our behalf, **this data becomes the substrate of all action, judgment, and coordination**. It is not just an asset. It’s the fuel, the language, and the terrain.

And yet, most organisations treat it like exhaust.

## The Hidden Costs of Poor Data Design

Just as with functional specialization, treating data as purely technical creates hidden organizational debt:

1. **Knowledge Silos**: Data becomes trapped in functional teams
2. **Quality Decay**: No clear ownership of data quality across its lifecycle
3. **Lost Context**: Critical business context gets stripped away
4. **Conway's Law Effects**: Data structures mirror org charts, not business reality

## Why This Matters Even More Now

We’re entering a phase where tools will no longer ask, _“What do you want me to do?”_  
Instead, they will ask: _“What outcome do you want? I’ll figure out the steps.”_

This shift—from tool to agent—**makes the quality, structure, and accessibility of data a first-order concern.**

If your data is fragmented, siloed, poorly contextualised, or hidden behind org boundaries and tribal knowledge, then:
- Your agents will hallucinate, misfire, or underperform
- Your teams will drown in translation layers and rework
- Your strategy will be constrained by your least tractable data bottlenecks

## Shifting the Paradigm

Instead of asking "How do we manage our data?", we need to ask:

> "How do we design our organization to treat data as a first-class strategic asset?"

This reframing leads to different approaches:

### 1. **Data as a Product**

- Treat datasets like products with clear owners and stakeholders
- Apply product management principles to data lifecycle
- Focus on user needs and experiences, not just technical specifications

### 2. **All Teams are Data Teams**

- Embed data expertise across the organization
- Consider creating "data pods" in that combine business and technical skills in key areas
- Focus on outcomes over output

### 3. **Data Governance as Enabling Constraint**

- Design governance that enables innovation while maintaining quality
- Create clear decision rights and accountability
- Build feedback loops between data producers and consumers

## Organizational Design Implications

The real problem is organisational, not just technical. This shift requires rethinking several aspects of how we organize.

We’ve spent decades building pipelines, lakes, warehouses, lakehouses, and catalogs. And yet most organisations still struggle to answer basic cross-cutting questions about their operations, customers, and systems.

Why?

Because this isn’t a tooling problem. It’s a **sociotechnical and organisational design problem**.

You can't layer a “data strategy” on top of an organisation that wasn't designed to create, share, and learn from data as part of its core functioning.

Let’s point out the common anti-patterns.

### 1. **Ownership without responsibility**
Data is generated everywhere but owned nowhere. Product teams create it, infra teams store it, analysts clean it, and no one feels responsible for its lifecycle, meaning, or reusability.

### 2. **Data work is treated as cost, not capability**
Too often, work on data quality, modeling, documentation, and lineage is seen as overhead—something you squeeze in “if there’s time.” Meanwhile, delivery pressure drives shortcuts that poison long-term optionality.

### 3. **Incentives reinforce fragmentation**
Different departments optimise for their own goals. Sales logs data one way, support another. Product managers hoard insights. Legal locks down access. Data becomes a reflection of org silos, not a unifying strategic fabric.

### 4. **Tooling abstracts away the real work**
Modern data stacks can give a false sense of progress. You can have perfect pipelines flowing into a state-of-the-art lakehouse—and still not know how many active users you have last quarter, or why a metric changed.

## Treating Data as a Strategic Asset Means...

We need to go far beyond governance frameworks and tech stacks. We need to **design our organisations as data-fluent systems.**

That means:

### 1. **Team-level accountability for data quality and meaning** - Teams that generate data must also be responsible for its semantic clarity, quality over time, and downstream utility. Think *data as a product*, but culturally embedded—not a side project.

### 2. **Cross-functional alignment around information needs** - Instead of each team defining its own schema of reality, we need shared models of the domain—kept alive through active stewardship, not doc rot. Context pods or capability squads should include data stewards by design.

### 3. **Organising for data discoverability and intent alignment** - Good metadata and cataloging are helpful—but only when paired with social and technical systems that make data legible to both humans and agents. This means:
- Discoverability by purpose, not just source
- Documentation embedded in usage contexts
- Feedback loops between consumers and producers

### 4. **Building data fluency into every role**
We need to stop outsourcing “data work” to a separate class of specialists. Instead, **every knowledge worker should have a baseline of data fluency**, and every team should have the means to reason about their data and its use.

### 5. **Team Structures**

Move from centralized data teams to:
- Embedded data capabilities in teams
- Data platform teams that focus on provide enabling infrastructure
- Data governance networks that span the organization and focus on securing the flow of data, not blocking it

### 6. **Incentive Alignment**

Create incentives that reward:
- Data quality over quantity
- Reuse over reinvention
- Context preservation over pure efficiency

## Agentic AI Raises the Stakes

Once you introduce agentic systems into your organisation, every flaw in your data becomes a multiplying factor in systemic fragility.

- Agents need reliable state to plan and act
- They need well-modeled domains to reason about
- They need feedback signals to learn

This isn’t just about building the right APIs. It’s about **designing your organisation so that high-quality, context-rich data emerges as a natural byproduct of how work gets done.**

## The Path Forward

Success requires focusing on three key areas:

### 1. **Organizational Clarity**

- Clear ownership and decision rights
- Explicit data quality standards
- Visible value chains from data to decisions

### 2. **Technical Architecture**

- Platforms that enable rather than constrain
- Tools that preserve context
- Infrastructure that promotes discovery and reuse

### 3. **Cultural Transformation**

- Treating data as a shared asset
- Building data literacy at all levels
- Creating psychological safety around data quality issues

## Practical Steps

1. **Map Your Data Ecosystem**
   - Identify key data products
   - Map data flows and dependencies
   - Understand decision points and value creation

2. **Design for Evolution**
   - Create clear interfaces between teams
   - Build feedback loops into processes
   - Enable rapid experimentation and learning

3. **Invest in Capabilities**
   - Technical platforms that enable collaboration
   - Training and development programs
   - Metrics that matter

## Final Thoughts

As data becomes more central to how organizations operate and compete, the ability to design effective sociotechnical systems around data will become a critical capability.

Managing data as a strategic asset is not just a CIO or CDO problem. It’s a **whole-organisation design challenge**.

The organizations that thrive won't be those with the best technology, but those who best understand how to create environments where humans and machines can effectively collaborate around data to create value.

Focus on

- **Rewriting incentives** to reward data reusability, not just delivery
- **Building sociotechnical systems** that make high-leverage data work visible and valuable
- **Embedding data thinking** into org design, team structures, and operational rhythms

Remember: You can't solve sociotechnical problems with purely technical solutions. The way forward is through intentional design of the entire system—people, process, and technology.

In the age of agentic AI, your data is no longer just an asset—it’s the terrain your organisation navigates, the medium your AI thinks in, and the context your humans coordinate through.

Organisations that learn to flow with their data will outlearn, out-adapt, and outlast those that don't.
