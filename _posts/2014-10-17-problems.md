  If you think you can get rid of all your problems, take a look at what Ichak Adizes had to say about that...

What is the one thing in life you can be guaranteed of? 

**Change**. 

If you arenâ€™t changing it means you are dead, so be happy about that. But when things change, that does that cause?

**Problems**.

As a smart person when you are faced with a problem you find...

**Solutions**!

Aaand what do solutions cause...? 

**Oops.**

As you can see, you will *always* have problems:

The real question to ask is: Do you have the *right* problems?

For a new startup, battling with cashflow is the _right_ kind of problem to have. A company that has been around for 10 years and having cashflow issues is experiencing the _wrong_ problem.

Celebrate and embrace your right problems. Resist the urge sweep them under the rug or they will become wrong problems. When you find a genuine wrong problem, step back. Think about how the systems allowed that problem to happen and how the system could be changed to prevent it in future.

*Note: I first came across the change-problems-solutions loop via the work of [Izak Adizes][adizes]*
