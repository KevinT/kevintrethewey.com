  One of my more recent projects is a 1100 litre mixed reef marine fish tank.

This is my first salt water tank, after keeping fresh water tanks for a few years. Sea life is just so different to what we encounter in every day life. Learning about the different creatures, their behaviours and how to maintain them is fascinating to me. 

It is the sort of hobby that will take a lifetime to master - a confluence of marine biology, chemistry, lighting, plumbing, electricity, aesthetic design and several other fields. I think I am also drawn to it because it's an opportunity to work with my hands on something, which is a nice contrast from during the week when I am mostly using my mind.
