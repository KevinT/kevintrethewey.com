The Interactive Spine Mapper is a digital tool that makes the [Spine Model](/projects/spinemodel/) framework accessible and actionable for individuals and organizations. It provides a guided, interactive experience for working through the hierarchical structure of Needs, Values, Principles, Practices, and Tools.

## Key Features

The tool helps users:

1. **Identify Core Needs**: Start by articulating the fundamental needs that drive your situation or challenge
2. **Define Values**: Explore what values emerge from those needs and matter most in your context
3. **Establish Principles**: Develop guiding principles that align with your values
4. **Design Practices**: Create specific practices that embody your principles
5. **Select Tools**: Choose tools that support your practices and serve your higher-level needs

## Interactive Experience

The mapper provides:

- **Guided Flow**: Step-by-step process through each level of the spine
- **Contextual Prompts**: Helpful questions and examples at each stage
- **Visual Mapping**: Clear visualization of relationships between spine levels  
- **Export Capabilities**: Save and share your completed spine mappings
- **Templates**: Pre-built starting points for common organizational scenarios

This tool complements the conceptual framework documented at [SpineModel.info](http://spinemodel.info) by providing a practical, hands-on way to apply the model to real situations.
