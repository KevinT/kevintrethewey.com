The idea of Team Tourism was that individuals would get a physical passport that they could use to visit a participating team. That team would allow them to visit for a few hours and explore the environment, meet the team, and see how they work. The team would be provided with a custom stamp to put in the passport to record the visit.

This created a cross-organizational network of people who could visit each other, and a community of people who could learn about different ways of working.

The concept emerged from a conversation between myself and [David Campey][campey] around 2013. At first it was just a couple of us (I particularly remember [Mark Pearl][pearl] being very active) asking friends in the software development industry if we could come and visit their environments as a tourist. It evolved into a community project, lost momentum with a few key people emigrating, and then covid put an end to visits, after which it has not (yet) recovered.
