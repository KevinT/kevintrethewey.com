The seed for Team Tourism as a concept was planted during a conversation between myself and [David Campey][campey] around 2013. At first it was just a couple of us (I particularly remember [Mark Pearl][pearl] being very active) asking friends in the software development industry if we could come and visit their environments as a tourist.

From there my company [Driven][driven] invested some time and money into putting up a website and printing awesome physical passports to take with on our visits.

You can learn more about the idea, and order your passport from the website: [TeamTourism.directory][teamtourism]. The long term plan is to grow the TT community internationally, facilitating connections with people around the world!
