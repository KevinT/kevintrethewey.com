  In 2019 I started taking lessons at [Digby Hoet's](https://www.digbyhoets.com/) pottery studio. I now have my own small home studio.

I have always enjoyed working with my hands, and have found it to be a great way to relax and clear my mind. I particularly enjoy gathering wild clay and making things out of that.

I mostly do wheel thrown pots, but I also enjoy the challenge of hand building and carving clay into useful objects.

Here are some of the pieces I have made over the years:
