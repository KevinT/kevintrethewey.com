  Beginning in 2007 with an empty plot of land, the tallest thing was an anthill, my wife and I developed the property into a paradise for our family, with a large family home, cottage, rolling lawns and gardens.

Starting with owner-building a cottage in 2010, and then having the privilege to work with a great architect, builder and QS to develop our dream home, looking down the valley into the sunsets. 

We planted over 300 trees, many of which I grew from seed. Other great features we added in the 15 years we lived on the property:

1. A "house-tree", because the trees had not grown large enough for a tree-house
1. A pool with the deep end in the middle (because that makes sense, right?)
1. Everything two young boys could ever want - from the trampoline and jungle gym when they were toddlers to the zip-line, cricket nets and football field as they grew up

We sold the property in 2025 to move closer to our boy's school. This became a great life lesson on putting effort in to get the rewards, and letting go when the time comes to move on to new things.
