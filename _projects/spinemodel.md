  The Spine Model is a model that emerged through [Danie Roux](http://danieroux.com), [Sandra Rheeder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-rheeder-45931815/) and I collaborating on a coaching engagement at a local merchant bank in 2014. Since then it has taken on a life of its own.

The model is an extension of [Kent Beck's][beck] frameing of [eXtreme Programming][xp] ideas as Values, then Principles, then Practices. We added the way Needs where modelled in [Marshall Rosenberg's][rosenberg] [Non-Violent Communication][nvc] above Values. Then we added Tools on the bottom because that made sense. That formed the basis of the Spine Model structure, but the thinking and the way we apply it has been influenced by many people over time and it continues to evolve today.

The model is published primarily on two different websites...

* [SpineModel.info][model] describes the model and how it can be applied.
* [Spine.wiki][wiki] is a wiki-style catalogue of items at the five different spine levels.
