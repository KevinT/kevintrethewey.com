Advisor Pro was a bank-grade digital wealth platform that enhanced the way financial advisors run their businesses, and built by Jemstep by Invesco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco ([IVZ][IVZ]).

I was Director of Engineering of Jemstep for two and a half years, and led the delivery effort across multiple teams and geographical regions.
