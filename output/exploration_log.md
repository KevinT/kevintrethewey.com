**Exploring**: Framework Learning Architecture and Health Check Infrastructure
**Method**: Systematic examination of .ravl directory structure, learning storage patterns, logging infrastructure, and state management

### Discoveries:
- **Dual Learning System**: Found separate directories for execution_learning (infrastructure) vs loop_learning (domain logic)
- **Structured Learning Storage**: Framework uses both markdown (human-readable) and JSON (machine-parseable) for learning persistence
- **Multi-Category Logging**: Identified 1 distinct logging categories: llm
- **State Persistence**: Framework maintains current_state/ directory for tracking loop state across runs
- **Loop Configuration System**: Found 0 YAML-based loop configuration files
- **Health Check Infrastructure**: Discovered 14 health-check related artifacts embedded in framework

### Key Insights:

#### 1. Separation of Concerns in Learning
The framework implements a sophisticated dual-learning architecture that separates "how to execute" (solution space) from "what to accomplish" (problem space). This means:
- Syntax errors, API auth failures → execution_learning/
- Missing data, incomplete analysis → loop_learning/
- Each system can improve independently without interference

#### 2. Hybrid Human-Machine Learning Format
Learning isn't just data dumping - it combines:
- Markdown files for context, explanations, and human debugging
- JSON files for structured patterns that can be machine-processed
- This enables both LLM reasoning AND programmatic health checks

#### 3. Observable Execution Through Logging
The multi-category logging system (llm) suggests the framework makes execution transparent for debugging. This is critical for health checks to diagnose failures accurately.

### Significance:
These discoveries reveal that RAVL is not just a simple loop framework - it's a **learning system with self-improvement capabilities**. The separation between execution and domain learning means:

1. **Targeted Improvement**: Framework can diagnose whether failures are "I couldn't run the code" vs "I ran it but didn't solve the problem"
2. **Persistent Intelligence**: Learning accumulates across runs in structured formats that both humans and LLMs can query
3. **Observable Execution**: Rich logging infrastructure enables health checks to pinpoint exact failure modes
4. **Adaptive Architecture**: The loop configuration system suggests multiple specialized loops can work together

**Next Exploration Opportunities**:
- Examine actual learning file contents to understand pattern extraction
- Analyze health check logic to see how diagnostics work
- Investigate loop configuration to understand orchestration patterns
- Map the verification criteria system and how it drives learning
