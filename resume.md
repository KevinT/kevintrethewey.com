  Over the course of my career I have had the opportunity to work in and observe projects, teams and organisations in vastly different environments, and seen vastly differing levels of success amongst them. Through my experiences I have grown an understanding of the values, principles and practices that are required for healthy systems, as well as gained deep experience in how to bring these into organisations.
